# Aeonian-Source
An unrestricted environment exploit for Roblox. Runs scripts at an identity of 6

This was the old Aeonian source that i am no longer working on due to how it is going to be superseded by Aeonian V4 which is an exploit that utilises a method of excecution called ProtoConversion founded by chirality in 2015, which is better and faster but at the same time harder

this is an exploit that utilises Autumns method of wrapping to achive execution on roblox
this exploit uses the same method of execution that other exploits use such as<br />
Cyber v1/2/3/ and possibly v4 idk there has been so many versions of cyber I lost track ages ago XD<br />
Axon v1 <br />
Flame V3 <br />
Bleu v1 <br />
WRDAPI Lua Execution (not the restricted one) (Oh wait that is axon ha) <br />

Old Exploits That Used The Same Method<br />
Terv<br />
Seraph<br />
Synapse (in its beta, also the predesecor to raindrop)<br />
Raindrop<br />

# What Features Does This Have?

# Honourable Mentions

Anthony/Core - Teaching Me About Wrappers And Wrapping<br />
Autumn (Bless Her) Literally Taking Time Out Of Her Day To Teach Me Everything From Start To Finish Even Though She Quit The Exploit Community Years Ago, Huge Thanks To Her<br />
Cirmolddry - Uhh I Guess You Taught Me About Caching (In The Weirdest Way Possible)<br />

And Most Of All:<br />

Aero - Letting Axon Get Leaked<br />
If axon was never leaked i would have never met all these amazing people and i would have never gotten into roblox exploiting which is something i thoroughly enjoy to the max and it's something i do every day. So thanks for that aero i really appreciate it even if it wasn't supposed to be a good thing (which it wasn't) :P<br />
